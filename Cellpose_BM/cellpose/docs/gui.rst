GUI
------------------------------

Starting the GUI 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The quickest way to start is to open the GUI from a command line terminal. You might need to open an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path:
::

    python -m cellpose

The first time cellpose runs it downloads the latest available trained model weights from the website.

You can **drag and drop** images (.tif, .png, .jpg, .gif) into the GUI and run Cellpose, and/or manually segment them. When the GUI is processing, you will see the progress bar fill up and during this time you cannot click on anything in the GUI. For more information about what the GUI is doing you can look at the terminal/prompt you opened the GUI with. 
For example data, see `cellpose website <https://www.cellpose.org>`_. For best accuracy and runtime performance, resize images so cells are less than 100 pixels across. 

For multi-channel, multi-Z tiff's, the expected format is Z x channels x Ly x Lx.

.. note::
    The output file with the masks is in the same folder as the loaded
    image with ``_seg.npy`` appended. The GUI automatically saves after you 
    draw an ROI but NOT after running a model for
    segmentation and NOT after 3D mask drawing (too slow). Save in the file
    menu or with Ctrl+S. 

.. note::
    Since the output file is in the same folder as the loaded
    image with ``_seg.npy`` appended, make sure you have WRITE access 
    in the folder, otherwise the file will not save.

Using the GUI 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GUI serves two main functions:

1. Running the segmentation algorithm.
2. Manually labelling data.
3. (NEW) Fine-tuning a pretrained cellpose model on your own data.

Main GUI mouse controls (works in all views):

-  Pan = left-click + drag
-  Zoom = scroll wheel (or +/= and - buttons)
-  Full view = double left-click
-  Select mask = left-click on mask
-  Delete mask = Ctrl (or Command on Mac) + left-click
-  Merge masks = Alt + left-click (will merge last two)
-  Start draw mask = right-click
-  End draw mask = right-click, or return to circle at beginning

Overlaps in masks are NOT allowed. If you draw a mask on top of another
mask, it is cropped so that it doesn't overlap with the old mask. Masks
in 2D should be single strokes (if *single_stroke* is checked).

If you want to draw masks in 3D, then you can turn *single_stroke*
option off and draw a stroke on each plane with the cell and then press
ENTER. 

.. note::
    3D labelling will fill in unlabelled z-planes so that you do not
    have to densely label, for example you can skip some planes.


Segmentation options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SIZE: you can manually enter the approximate diameter for your cells, or
press "calibrate" to let the model estimate it. The size is represented
by a disk at the bottom of the view window (can turn this disk off by
unchecking "scale disk on").

use GPU: if you have installed the cuda version of mxnet, then you can activate this, but it won't give huge speedups when running single images in the GUI.

MODEL: there is a *cytoplasm* model and a *nuclei* model, choose what you want to segment

CHAN TO SEG: this is the channel in which the cytoplasm or nuclei exist

CHAN2 (OPT): if *cytoplasm* model is chosen, then choose the nuclear channel for this option

Training your own cellpose model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out this `video <https://youtu.be/3Y1VKcxjNy4>`_ to learn the process.

1. Drag and drop an image from a folder of images with a similar style (like similar cell types).
2. Run the built-in models on one of the images using the "model zoo" and find the one that works best for your data. Make sure that if you have a nuclear channel you have selected it for CHAN2.
3. Fix the labelling by drawing new ROIs (right-click) and deleting incorrect ones (CTRL+click). The GUI autosaves any manual changes (but does not autosave after running the model, for that click CTRL+S). The segmentation is saved in a ``_seg.npy`` file.
4. Go to the "Models" menu in the File bar at the top and click "Train new model..." or use shortcut CTRL+T.
5. Choose the pretrained model to start the training from (the model you used in #2), and type in the model name that you want to use. The other parameters should work well in general for most data types. Then click OK.
6. The model will train (much faster if you have a GPU) and then auto-run on the next image in the folder. Next you can repeat #3-#5 as many times as is necessary.
7. The trained model is available to use in the future in the GUI in the "custom model" section and is saved in your image folder.

If you have **3D** data, please save random XY, YZ and XZ slices through your 3D data, 
ideally sufficiently spaced from each other so the information each slice has is 
distinct. Then put these slices into a folder and start the human-in-the-loop training. 
You can then use the new custom model on new 3D data. 

.. note::
    You can only start training with one of the built-in Cellpose models or from scratch. 
    When you start training from a built-in model or from scratch each time, then you are training 
    the network on all the previously labelled images in the folder and weighting them equally in 
    your training set. 

    If you restart from a previous retraining, you are biasing the network towards the earlier 
    images it has already been trained on. Conversely, if you have created a custom model 
    with different images, and you retrain that model, then you are downweighting the images 
    that you have already trained on and excluded from your new training set. Therefore, we recommend having all images 
    that you want to be trained for the same model in the same folder so they are all used.

See the Models doc for info on the new model zoo and suggestion mode.

Contributing training data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are very excited about receiving community contributions to the training data and re-training the cytoplasm model to make it better. Please follow these guidelines:

1. Run cellpose on your data to see how well it does. Try varying the diameter, which can change results a little. 
2. If there are relatively few mistakes, it won't help much to contribute labelled data. 
3. If there are consistent mistakes, your data is likely very different from anything in the training set, and you should expect major improvements from contributing even just a few manually segmented images.
4. For images that you contribute, the cells should be at least 10 pixels in diameter, and there should be **at least** several dozens of cells per image, ideally ~100. If your images are too small, consider combining multiple images into a single big one and then manually segmenting that. If they are too big, consider splitting them into smaller crops. 
5. For the manual segmentation, please try to outline the boundaries of the cell, so that everything (membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus) is inside the boundaries. Do not just outline the cytoplasm and exclude the membrane, because that would be inconsistent with our own labelling and we wouldn't be able to use that. 
6. Do not use the results of the algorithm in any way to do contributed manual segmentations. This can reinforce a vicious circle of mistakes, and compromise the dataset for further algorithm development. 

If you are having problems with the nucleus model, please open an issue before contributing data. Nucleus images are generally much less diverse, and we think the current training dataset already covers a very large set of modalities. 
Additionally, you can run a non-nuclear model on nuclear data such as cyto.
